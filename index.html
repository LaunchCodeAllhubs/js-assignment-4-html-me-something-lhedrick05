               <h2>Drumm Farm</h2>
               <testP>
                  <funParagraph>This has been my favorite course since the first time that I played golf. I played in a tournament for my first time golfing with my Dad and brothers, which then turned into an annual tournament. They have since decided not to hold that event at this course any longer, but I have so many fond memories of this course and I will never forget it. I had the pleasure of working there until I got a promotion that sent me to another golf club. I am proud of the time and work that I put in at Drumm and I would do it all over again. This course will always hold a special place in my heart.</funParagraph>

               <h2>Mules National</h2>
               <p>This course is one of my favorites around the Kansas City area. It is a little bit of a drive for me since it is in Warrensburg which is about 30 minutes or so, but well worth the drive. The conditions are always superb, and they 18th green is an island green, which makes the tee-shot a little daunting, but also that much more satisfying when you make it on. I would highly recommend this course to anyone that does not live in the area and is looking for a new, nice course to play. </p>

               <h2>Lionsgate</h2>
               <p>I was only able to play this course once because I had a friend who worked there and it is a private course. I would say that this would be the nicest course that I have played. It was designed by Jack Nicklaus and it shows. The course is extremely challening and I wish I was able to play it again someday becuase I am a much better golfer now, than I was when I was able to play it. If someone asked me to come and play it again, I would find a way to make it work.</p>

               <h2>Falcon Ridge</h2>
               <p>This is one of the private golf clubs that my company owns and I have had the priveledge to play it a few times now. Before I even worked for the comapany that I am at though, I had played in the annual tournament mentioned above when they decided to change the venue. It is a charity tournament that my dad's company would host every year and it was easier for everyone to play in Kansas as most of the company had lived on that side of the state line.</p>

               <h2>Blue Springs</h2>
               <p>This just happens to be the course that I help manage. I am the assistant general manager of this club and it is a great course! I take pride in what I do and work as hard as I can to make everyone's experience a good one. My course is challenging and has very tight fairways. It's best to always play the safe shot on this course due to it being so unforgiving. My personal best here is an 80. Which is 8 over par with par being 72 at this course. I am by no means a professional, but I am a decent golfer. My co-workers are great as well and I wouldn't change anything about the team that we have on-board this season. Everyone gets along really well and we are hitting our budget targets on every front. Things have been going well!</p>

               <h2>Osage National</h2>
               <p>I had always grown up hearing about this course and let me tell you, the time that I finally got to play it was great! My oldest brother had told me about it when I was young and I wasn't quite into golf yet. But, now that I am older, my friend had a bachelar party at the lake and we played this course. They actually have 3 separate 9-hole courses, but we only played two of them for 18 holes. We played the Mountain Course and the River Course. The mountain was by far the better track becuase of the elevation changes and all of the cool views due to that. I would go back in a heartbeat. I am just fortunate that I work for the same company that owns this course as well. GreatLife owns a good amount of courses and that is one of the best perks of the job is being able to play all of these cool courses for free. </p>
