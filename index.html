               <h2>Drumm Farm</h2>
               <p>This has been my favorite course since the first time that I played golf. I played in a tournament for my first time golfing with my Dad and brothers, which then turned into an annual tournament. They have since decided not to hold that event at this course any longer, but I have so many fond memories of this course and I will never forget it. I had the pleasure of working there until I got a promotion that sent me to another golf club. I am proud of the time and work that I put in at Drumm and I would do it all over again. This course will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

               <h2>Mules National</h2>
               <p>This course is one of my favorites around the Kansas City area. It is a little bit of a drive for me since it is in Warrensburg which is about 30 minutes or so, but well worth the drive. The conditions are always superb, and they 18th green is an island green, which makes the tee-shot a little daunting, but also that much more satisfying when you make it on. I would highly recommend this course to anyone that does not live in the area and is looking for a new, nice course to play. </p>

               <h2>Lionsgate</h2>
               <p>I was only able to play this course once because I had a friend who worked there and it is a private course. I would say that this would be the nicest course that I have played. It was designed by Jack Nicklaus and it shows. The course is extremely challening and I wish I was able to play it again someday becuase I am a much better golfer now, than I was when I was able to play it. If someone asked me to come and play it again, I would find a way to make it work.</p>
